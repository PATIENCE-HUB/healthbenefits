    <h1>How Much Vitamin C Should You Take?</h1>
<p>Vitamin C is a water-soluble nutrient with many vital functions in your body.
</p>

<p>It helps strengthen your immune system, aids collagen production and wound healing, and acts as an antioxidant to protect your cells from free radical damage</p>

<p>Vitamin C is also known as L-ascorbic acid, or simply ascorbic acid.</p>

<p>Unlike other animals, humans cannot synthesize vitamin C on their own. Therefore, you must get enough of it from foods or supplements to maintain good health</p>

<p>This article explains the recommended dosage of vitamin C for optimal health.</p>
<h2>What’s the recommended intake?</h2>
<p>The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has developed a set of reference values for specific nutrient intake levels, including for vitamin C.
</p>
<p>One set of guidelines is known as the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) and considers average daily nutrient intake from both foods and supplements.
</p>
<p>RDA recommendations for specific gender and age groups should meet the nutrient needs of 97–98% of healthy individuals (10Trusted Source).
</p>
<p>Here are the RDAs for vitamin C (11):
