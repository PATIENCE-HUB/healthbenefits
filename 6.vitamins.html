    <h1>9 Health Benefits of Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine)</h1>
<p>Vitamin B6, also known as pyridoxine, is a water-soluble vitamin that your body needs for several functions. It has health benefits for the body, including promoting brain health and improving mood.</p>

<p>It’s significant to protein, fat and carbohydrate metabolism and the creation of red blood cells and neurotransmitters</p>

<p>Your body cannot produce vitamin B6, so you must obtain it from foods or supplements.</p>

<p>Most people get enough vitamin B6 through their diet, but certain populations may be at risk for deficiency.</p>

<p>Consuming adequate amounts of vitamin B6 is important for optimal health and may even prevent and treat chronic diseases (2Trusted Source).</p>
<p>Here are 9 health benefits of vitamin B6, backed by science.</p>
<ol>
  <li>May Improve Mood and Reduce Symptoms of Depression</li>
<p>Vitamin B6 plays an important role in mood regulation.</p>
<p>This is partly because this vitamin is necessary for creating neurotransmitters that regulate emotions, including serotonin, dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid</p>
<li>May Promote Brain Health and Reduce Alzheimer’s Risk
</li>
<p>Vitamin B6 may play a role in improving brain function and preventing Alzheimer’s disease, but the research is conflicting.</p>
<li>May Prevent and Treat Anemia by Aiding Hemoglobin Production</li>
<p>Due to its role in hemoglobin production, vitamin B6 may be helpful in preventing and treating anemia caused by deficiency</p>
<p>Hemoglobin is a protein that delivers oxygen to your cells. When you have low hemoglobin, your cells don’t get enough oxygen. As a result, you may develop anemia and feel weak or tired.</p>
<li>May Be Useful in Treating Symptoms of PMS</li>
<p>Vitamin B6 has been used to treat symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, or PMS, including anxiety, depression and irritability.</p>
